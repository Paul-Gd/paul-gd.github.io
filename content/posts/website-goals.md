The main goal is to write about things that I enjoy such as programming, photographs that I've
taken and places where I traveled, and last but not least, quotes from books that I read and that
were meaningful to me.

## Programming
I want to explain a few things that I understood but never took time to explain. This is inspired by the [Feynman technique](https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/):
> 1. Choose the concepts that you want to learn
> 2. Pretend you are teaching to somebody with the understanding level of a 6-grade student
> 3. Identify gaps in your knowledge and go to step 1. Repeat until the explanation is  complete
> 4. Review explanation and simplify

I want to apply those steps to develop my teaching skills and to gain a deeper level of knowledge
while explaining some non-obvious programming related things.

## Travel/photography
Most of the time I traveled, I didn't bother posting some of the photos taken. My goal is to post
some photos and travel impressions of some places where I travel. I believe this will help me
better develop my photography skills.

## Memorable quotes
Ever felt like you read a book, got the main idea but cannot remember anything after a few months?

For me, the solution was to extract some of the quotes that inspired me from each book. It helps
me better remember the book content even after a long time and provides a quickly searchable index
to refer to.
